Grid Design:

       A1 A2 A3 O A5  
       B1 B2 B3 O B5  
       C1 C2 C3 X C5  
       D1 D2 D3 O D5  
       E1 E2 E3 O E5

#### Logic Design

*   Clear display
*   Method: Asking for name
*   Method: Get ship placement
*   Method: Determine if valid spot for ship
*   Storing ship information List per user?
*   Storing shot information List per user?
*   Method: create the grid for each user
*   Method: print out grid
*   Method: fire on opponent
*   Method: determine if a shot can be taken & outcome
*   Method: display score
*   Method: print winner and shots taken

#### Data Design

*   PlayerInfo
*   User's Name
*   Users 5 ship locations: List
*   User's shot/grid: List
*   GridSpot
*   SpotLetter: string
*   SpotNumber: int
